    instructions: `Archive a completed change in the experimental workflow.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run \`openspec list --json\` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show only active changes (not already archived).
   Include the schema used for each change if available.

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check artifact completion status**

   Run \`openspec status --change "<name>" --json\` to check artifact completion.

   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - \`schemaName\`: The workflow being used
   - \`artifacts\`: List of artifacts with their status (\`done\` or other)

   **If any artifacts are not \`done\`:**
   - Display warning listing incomplete artifacts
   - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to confirm user wants to proceed
   - Proceed if user confirms

3. **Check task completion status**

   Read the tasks file (typically \`tasks.md\`) to check for incomplete tasks.

   Count tasks marked with \`- [ ]\` (incomplete) vs \`- [x]\` (complete).

   **If incomplete tasks found:**
   - Display warning showing count of incomplete tasks
   - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to confirm user wants to proceed
   - Proceed if user confirms

   **If no tasks file exists:** Proceed without task-related warning.

4. **Assess delta spec sync state**

   Check for delta specs at \`openspec/changes/<name>/specs/\`. If none exist, proceed without sync prompt.

   **If delta specs exist:**
   - Compare each delta spec with its corresponding main spec at \`openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md\`
   - Determine what changes would be applied (adds, modifications, removals, renames)
   - Show a combined summary before prompting

   **Prompt options:**
   - If changes needed: "Sync now (recommended)", "Archive without syncing"
   - If already synced: "Archive now", "Sync anyway", "Cancel"

   If user chooses sync, proceed with normal archive (without \`--skip-specs\`) so archive applies spec updates.
   If user chooses to skip sync, archive with \`--skip-specs\`.

5. **Perform the archive via CLI**

   Execute one of:

   \`\`\`bash
   # Sync specs during archive (default)
   openspec archive "<name>" --yes

   # Skip spec sync when user requested "Archive without syncing"
   openspec archive "<name>" --yes --skip-specs
   \`\`\`

   If the user explicitly asked to skip validation, append \`--no-validate\`.
   Surface the CLI result, including archive path and spec sync outcome.

6. **Display summary**

   Show archive completion summary including:
   - Change name
   - Schema that was used
   - Archive location
   - Whether specs were synced (if applicable)
   - Note about any warnings (incomplete artifacts/tasks)

**Output On Success**

**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** ✓ Synced to main specs (or "No delta specs" or "Sync skipped")

**Guardrails**
- Always prompt for change selection if not provided
- Use artifact graph (openspec status --json) for completion checking
- Don't block archive on warnings - just inform and confirm
- Preserve .openspec.yaml as part of the archived change
- Show clear summary of what happened
- If delta specs exist, always run the sync assessment and show the combined summary before prompting`,
